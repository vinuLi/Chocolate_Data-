# Chocolate_Data-
This is the R code to visualize the rating of a dataset extracted from Kaggle.com on chocolate ratings.
Chocolate is one of the most favorite candies in the world. People eat billions of pounds of chocolates in a year all around the world. It is said that only in the United States people eat over 2.8 billion pounds of chocolate per year. But the taste of these chocolates is not the same. Unlike in the early days, milk chocolate and dark chocolate are not the only options for people now. The goal of the project is to find how the chocolate bars were rated. The analysis is done using the chocolate dataset where rating was given by people according to taste. The chocolate data set is downloaded from Kaggle.com. The dataset contains information on more than 1800 brands and their ratings, variety of cholate used in them, their main tastes, and their origin.
